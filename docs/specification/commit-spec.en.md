## Suggestions on Merge Request/Pull Request

Developers may have some simple commit messages on their own forked branches. It is recommended to refine commit messages using git rebase before submitting merge requests. Please refer to the previous section for refining information. Please refer to the following procedure for relevant commands.

```shell
#Use the new branch for feature development
git checkout feature1-pick
#Multiple debugging and commits
git commit -m "xxx"
git commit -m "yyy"
git commit -m "zzz"
#If new third-party dependencies are imported, use dep to manage dependencies 
dep ensure -v -add github.com/org/project

#Rebase operation, merge multiple changes (3 times below) on the feature1-pick branch 
# Complete standard commit information
git rebase -i HEAD~3

#Push to the remote repository
git push origin feature1-pick:feature1-pick
#Submit PR/MR and wait for merging
#......................
#......................

#After the PR/MR is merged, synchronize the local master branch
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
```
